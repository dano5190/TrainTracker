# TrainTracker

TrainTracker is an app that takes user submitted train times, stores them in a Firebase database, then tracks the train progress with moment.js compared to the present time.
The information the user is able to enter include the train name, the train's destination, the time the train started in military time, and the lebngth of the trains trip to that location (or frequency).  THis information could be real or fictional.
This information is taken from the database and populated in a table, and used to calculate and display when the train is estimated to arrive, and how much time (in minutes) until it does.
If the minutes away is negative, then the time has already passed.
